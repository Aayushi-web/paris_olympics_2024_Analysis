# Paris Olympics 2024 Analysis

This project provides an in-depth data analysis of the Paris Olympics 2024, focusing on various aspects such as event details, country performances, medal counts, athlete statistics, and predictions for the upcoming games.

## Features

- **Event Data**: A comprehensive collection of all events scheduled for the Paris Olympics 2024, including categories, schedules, and participating countries.
- **Medal Analysis**: Visualization and analysis of the medal distribution across countries, athletes, and sports.
- **Country Performance**: Insight into each country's performance history in previous Olympics, comparing with potential medal predictions for Paris 2024.
- **Athlete Insights**: Profiling top athletes and their potential to win medals, based on historical performance.
- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive and static graphs and charts to present trends, performance statistics, and medal predictions.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from multiple reliable APIs and official datasets provided by the **International Olympic Committee (IOC)**, sports federations, and other relevant sources.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paris-olympics-2024-analysis.git
   cd paris-olympics-2024-analysis

   ### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies. If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it using:

```bash```
pip install virtualenv
Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash```
Copy
# On Windows
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Then, install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ### Step 3: Requirements
The following libraries and frameworks are required to run the project:

tensorflow or pytorch (depending on the deep learning framework you choose)

opencv-python (for video input processing)

numpy (for numerical operations)

dlib (for facial landmark detection)

imutils (for image processing)

mediapipe (optional, for enhanced eye tracking)

You can install all the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ### Step 4: Prepare the Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset of eye images labeled with corresponding gestures. You can either use publicly available datasets or capture your own eye images performing various gestures.

 ### Step 5: Train the Model
Once the dataset is ready, use the provided script to train the deep learning model:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py --dataset path_to_dataset --epochs 50
 ### Step 6: Run the Gesture Recognition
After training the model, you can use the recognition script to test the model with real-time video input:

bash
Copy
python recognize_gesture.py
This script will open a video window displaying the live feed and will overlay the predicted gesture on detected faces.
